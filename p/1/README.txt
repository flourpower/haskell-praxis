I wanted to use the State monad for this, otherwise it could have been shorter.
It's defined twice somewhere and I couldn't fix the error, so I made my own definition, similar to the one in LYAH.
I also defined some utility functions for converting characters back and forth.
Finally, I made a Stack module, which I'll probably be using again and should flesh out with more functions.
